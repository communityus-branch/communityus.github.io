## What We Do:
**We bring people and things together - first here at home and then into surrounding areas; business and public sector.** ```create github issue to get started```

We will provide free access to tools usually reserved for enterprise. With a simple approach of Play/Sow/Reap you will get equiped with knowledge you need to help deploy new services to your sector. 

Tech isn't the star, your community is the star (the people!) Our tech and by extension the tools we provide and services featured are simply a manifestation of the communities we serve.
