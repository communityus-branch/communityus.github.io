## About Us:

//lets update this.

**A by-product of community**

_Raise the bar while remaining steadfast to your core business processes using open source and freely licensed tools and services_ 

## What We Do:
**We bring people and things together - first here at home and then into surrounding areas; business and public sector.** ```create github issue to get started```

We provide solutions usually reserved for enterprise and training so you can self deploy our new tools and services. Free from worry of licensing and hidden charges, everything can be done at no cost, or at different price ranges for support and training.

For us the tech isn't the star, your community is (the people!) Our tech and by extension the tools we provide and services featured are simply a manifestation of the communities we serve.
