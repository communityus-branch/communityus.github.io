## About Us:

**A byproduct of community**

_Leading the charge, whilst remaining steadfast to your core business processes -- Let us elevate your organization using open source and freely licensed solutions_ 

To enable a biz/org/church to have access to tools usually reserved for enterprise corps. With a simple approach of Play/Sow/Reap. 

Tech isn't the star, your community is (the people!) our tech and by extension the tools we provide and services featured are simply a manifestation of the community. 

**We build and maintain solutions for RHEL and upsteam. Here to serve. We bring people and things together - first here at home and then into surrounding areas; business and public sector.** ```create github issue to get started```
